2019-10-11

## Objectives

1. Define IDE and workspaces, differences between these and workflows using traditional productivity applications.
2. Explore Creative Cloud as an IDE.
3. Define use cases for Adobe Illustrator, integrations with other Creative Cloud products.

## Intro to IDE

IDE stands for _integrated development environment_.

* Traditionally used for software development.
* In addition to views and tools for editing code and documents, IDE provide resources for running code, evaluating parameters and variables, information on dependencies and paths, etc.

1. A default view in MS Word:

## Getting started with Illustrator

Adobe Creative Cloud apps have IDE-like features and GUIs. The Creative Cloud suite is a comprehensive IDE for digital design and production.

Let's explore some of these features in Illustrator:

1. Launch Illustrator. Click on _File->New_ or _Create New..._
2. Note settings for templates and presets.
3. We are going to create a postcard, which has a front and a back.
   * Change w/h units to inches and do 5X8
   * Set 'Artboards' to 2
   * Change orientation to landscape.
4. Hit _Create_.

Have a look around the workspace. In what ways is the GUI similar to productivity software like MS Excel or Word? In what ways is the GUI more like the IDE example we just looked at?

1. Tour of the interface - tools, windows, other aspects of the GUI and custom views.
2. In properties, click on document setup.
3. Note options - give both artboards a name. Use _Exit_ to get back to general properties.
